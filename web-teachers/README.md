# Teacher Cronchalytics

Giving teachers quantitative data so that they can make better-informed decisionsâ€”from planning nightly homework to even full courses.

# Setup

Copy `./src/Config.example.ts` into its own file `./src/Config.ts`. **Do not modify the `Config.example.ts` and instead put the proper credentials in this new file.** This new `Config.ts` is in the `.gitignore`, so credentials will not be committed.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
